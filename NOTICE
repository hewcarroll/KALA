1. EleutherAI Pythia Language Models
   https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia
   Copyright (c) 2023 EleutherAI
   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0

   The Pythia suite is a collection of models developed by EleutherAI to
   support scientific research on large language models. KALA builds upon
   Pythia models as its foundation for language understanding and generation.

   Pythia models and training data are described in:
   "Pythia: A Suite for Analyzing Large Language Models Across Training and Scaling"
   Biderman et al., 2023

   Key features used:
   - Transparent training provenance with 154 checkpoints per model
   - Public training data (The Pile)
   - Models ranging from 70M to 12B parameters
   - Research-friendly architecture for fine-tuning

   Copyright (c) 2024 Cole Fahlgren
   Licensed under the MIT License

   OpenClaw is an open-source framework for building agentic AI systems with
   tool-use capabilities. KALA adopts OpenClaw's architectural patterns for
   safe, auditable AI automation.

   Key design patterns adopted:
   - 6-stage execution pipeline (input standardization, session coordination,
     lane queue system, agent runner, agentic loop, audit trail)
   - JSONL transcript logging for full reproducibility
   - Sandboxed tool execution with allowlist-based security
   - Context window management and multi-turn reasoning
   - Semantic snapshot approach to web browsing

Acknowledgements

We are deeply grateful to:

- The EleutherAI team for their commitment to open, transparent AI research
  and for making Pythia models publicly available with full training provenance.

- Cole Fahlgren and the OpenClaw community for pioneering open-source patterns
  for safe, auditable AI agent systems.

- The broader open-source AI community for advancing the state of ethical,
  transparent, and accessible AI technology.

KALA stands on the shoulders of these giants, combining their innovations
to create a locally-deployable, ethics-bound AI system designed for
human-AI partnership.
